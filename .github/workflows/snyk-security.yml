# # A sample workflow which sets up Snyk to analyze the full Snyk platform (Snyk Open Source, Snyk Code,
# # Snyk Container and Snyk Infrastructure as Code)
# # The setup installs the Snyk CLI - for more details on the possible commands
# # check https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/cli-reference
# # The results of Snyk Code are then uploaded to GitHub Security Code Scanning
# #
# # For more examples, including how to limit scans to only high-severity issues
# # and fail PR checks, see https://github.com/snyk/actions/
